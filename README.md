# Second semester final project

## This project was made for my Data Science course in Ariel University

This term's final project consists of four different parts, each a Jupyter Notebook of its own.


* In the Classification problem project, we were instructed to try and improve our classification assignment from last term, using the knowledge we'd gained this term.
I used several ensemble learning models to try and achieve this.


* In my second project, the Fashion Mnist notebook, the goal was to train the models in order to predict the piece of clothing or accessory in the photos we were given.
I uploaded the data, used PCA to reduce itâ€™s dimensions, and proceeded to use models in order to reach results. I used ensemble learning models here as well.


* The third project is on the well known cats vs dogs dataset. We were given 25,000 photos of cats and dogs for analysis. I used some basic models as well as ensemble models.


* The purpose of my last project, Hands, was to classify between three different situations in the way people communicate with each other, given many datasets describing human hand movement.
I had to upload a great amount of data, manipulate it and clean it as instructed. I then split the data into training and testing sets, and used several models to make predictions.
